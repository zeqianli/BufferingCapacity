For the paper [Environmental modulators of algae-bacteria interactions at scale](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.23.534036v1).

Code to calculate the titration curve of a complex media with multiple buffers (P, MOS, Tris, NH4). 

See *demo.ipynb* for a demo of predicting initial pH of a complex medium.
